# Lidar_Data
Using this code it is possible to extract raw data using Modbus TCP/IP from the Lidar unit. This data gets interpreted and may be used for different purposes such as the digital twin.
The register numbers are based on the Modbus Guide by the manufacturer ZXLidar. 
It is important to be aware that the Modbus function is read only. Any changes to the Lidar unit must be made using the Waltz Software.
